        <h3>Early Life:</h3>
        <p>Gabriel García Márquez was born in Aracataca, Colombia. As a 13-year-old,<br>
            he came to Bogotá to study in a secondary school. Later he began to study<br>
            law, but abandoned these studies to work as a journalist and writer. During<br>
            the 1950s and 1960s, he worked as a foreign correspondent in Paris,<br>
            New York and elsewhere. In the late 1960s he left journalism to devote<br>
            himself to his creative writing full-time. Eventually García Márquez settled<br>
            in Mexico City, where he lived until his death.</p>

    <div id="work">
        <h3>Work:</h3>
        <p>Gabriel García Márquez’s international breakthrough came with the novel <br>
            Cien años de soledad (1967) (One Hundred Years of Solitude). He is one<br>
            of the foremost interpreters of magical realism in literature, a genre<br>
            in which the framework narrative is set in a real place and time, but
            supernatural and dreamlike elements are part of the portrayal. The<br>
            novels El otoño del patriarca (1975) (The Autumn of the Patriarch)<br>
            and El amor en los tiempos del colera (1985) (Love in the Time of Cholera)
            cemented his position as one of the greatest Latin American writers of all<br>
            time.<br></p>

        <h3>Legacy:</h3>
        <p>García Márquez was known for his capacity to create vast, minutely woven<br>
            plots and brief, tightly knit narratives in the fashion of his two North
            American models, William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. The easy flow<br>
            of even the most intricate of his stories has been compared to that
            of Miguel de Cervantes, as have his irony and overall humour. García Márquez’s<br>
            novelistic world is mostly that of provincial Colombia, where medieval and
            modern practices and beliefs clash both comically and tragically.<br>
            He eventually was awarded the Nobel prize for literature.</p>

    <div id="death">
        <h3>Death:</h3>
        <p>In 1999 the writer was diagnosed with lymphoma, or cancer of the immune system.
            The illness was to cloud his final years, requiring constant treatment. At
            times he was so ill that the international rumour mill not only proclaimed him
            to be at death's door several times, but apocryphal tales of his death-bed
            conversion to Catholicism circulated widely. Despite these rumours, he embarked
            on an ambitious autobiography. </p>
